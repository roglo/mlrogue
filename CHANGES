Version 0.01

  features added from initial version of linuxrogue :

  - Internationalization: speaks English (en), French (fr), French with use
    of the familias 'tu' (fr-tt), and few (very few) German (de). Note that
    other languages can be added by editing "rogue.lexicon", "rogue.instr"
    and "rogue.win". Specific grammatical features can be used in the
    lexicon. See file "translate.ml". Added option "-lang" to specify
    language, command "@" to change language while playing, otherwise
    language is read from variable LANG.

  - Added command "D" for discovered objects.

  - Improved wizard interface for adding objects.
