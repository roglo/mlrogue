ROGBOT IN ONE COMMAND

Rogbot is included in 'rogue' with the option -r. The command:
    ./rogue -r 1
plays rogue with the rogbot at speed 1. The speed is a float number:
0.5 plays slower, 2 plays twice faster, 1000 plays very fast.

ROGBOT IN TWO COMMANDS COMMUNICATING WITH SOCKETS

Rogbot can also run independently, the two programs communicating with
a local socket:
    ./rogue -r file
and in another terminal:
    ./rogbot -speed 1 file

REMARK

Rogbot must speak English. Possibly run it with option -lang en if it
does not speak English by default.

MAKE ANOTHER ROBOT IN OCAML OR C PLAYING THIS VERSION OF ROGUE

It is possible to write another rogbot. The file 'rogbot.ml' contains a
skeleton of the robot. Change the function 'play' to adapt to one's
strategy. In directory 'etc', the file 'rogbot.c' is another skeleton
for people prefering programming in C.

MAKE ROGBOT PLAY ANOTHER ROGUE CLONE

It is possible to make 'rogbot' talk with other rogue clones (no
guarantee, because of possible different features that rogbot is not
able to understand. If this clone is written in C, add the file
'etc/rogbotio.c' which contains two functions, one to initialize the
socket (rogbotio_socket), the other one to be called each time an
input character (as rogue command) is required (rogbotio_getchar).
