mlrogue version 1.05

OVERVIEW

This is linuxrogue translated from C into ocaml.

REQUIREMENTS

You need OCaml and Camlp5 to compile, freely distributed in the Web.

COMPILATION

Do: make

This creates a file named "rogue". Run it in this directory (no
"installation") by typing "./rogue".

DOCUMENTATION

For the doc, hmm... I hate making docs, type "?" in the game,
or read the source code. It is very close to "linuxrogue", so
you can download it in the Web and look at its doc files.
